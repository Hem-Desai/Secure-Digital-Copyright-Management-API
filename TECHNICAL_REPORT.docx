    - Minimum 12 characters
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one lowercase letter
    - At least one number
    - At least one special character
    - No common patterns
    """
```

### Encryption & Data Security

#### Key Management
```python
class SecureEnclaveService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.file_encryption = AESHandler()
        self.key_manager = KeyManager()
```

#### Data Protection
1. File Encryption
   - AES-256 in GCM mode
   - Unique IV per file
   - Authenticated encryption
   - Secure key storage

2. Data Transmission
   - Secure file transfer
   - Integrity verification
   - Session encryption
   - Token-based authentication

### Object-Oriented Design Principles

#### Encapsulation
- Secure enclave service encapsulating security operations
- Database abstraction layer
- File storage management

#### Inheritance
```python
class EncryptionStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def encrypt(self, data: bytes, key_id: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        pass
```

#### Polymorphism
- Storage strategies
- Encryption handlers
- Authentication methods

#### Abstraction
- High-level security interfaces
- Storage abstraction
- User management facade

### Error Handling & Secure Flow Control

#### Exception Management
```python
try:
    decrypted_data = self.file_encryption.decrypt(
        encrypted_data,
        artifact["encryption_key_id"]
    )
except Exception:
    self.logger.log_security_event("decryption_failed")
    return None
```

#### Security Controls
- Input validation
- Access verification
- Error logging
- Secure defaults

### Database Design & Structure

#### Tables
1. Users
   - ID (UUID)
   - Username
   - Password Hash
   - Role
   - Created At
   - Last Login

2. Artifacts
   - ID (UUID)
   - Name
   - Owner ID
   - Content Type
   - Encryption Key ID
   - Checksum
   - Created At

3. Audit Logs
   - ID (UUID)
   - Event Type
   - User ID
   - Timestamp
   - Details
